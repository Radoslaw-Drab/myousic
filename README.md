# Introduction

**Hey there!**

For a long time I've been downloading music using youtube and third party software.

However I found it time consuming, even few songs took a lot of time to import to Apple Music.

<br>

That's why I've challanged myself to create a script that could automatically do it for me.

It took a few days to make using `JavaScript` and `NodeJS`, but I've managed to accomplish my task.

I've also used `yt-dlp` for downloading from YouTube link and `exiftool` for changing metadata

# Instalation

## Tools

Tools to install:

1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (for downloading)
3. [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool)) (for editting metadata)

## Download

<hr>

Download code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Radoslaw-Drab/myousic) or using [git](https://git-scm.com/):

1. Install git
2. In console (CLI) move to directory you want script to be saved to using `cd`
3. Type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Radoslaw-Drab/myousic
```

# Usage

```bash
node myousic.js [OPTIONS]
```

<br>

## General options

<hr>

Every option with argument has to be separated with space (quotation marks are optional, but preffered). Order does not matter.

Example:

```bash
node myousic.js --search "Linkin Park - Lost"
```
