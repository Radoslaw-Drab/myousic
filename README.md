## Overview

**Myousic** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows you to:

1. **Download music** from YouTube using a provided YouTube link.
2. **Search for song metadata** (such as genre, artist, album, etc.) using the iTunes API.
3. **Manage the output and temporary storage** of downloaded files, including moving files to a specified folder and handling artwork.

The tool uses:

- **Flexible configuration** with options for customizing download and search behavior, genres, and more.

## iTunes API Search

The tool performs a search on iTunes using the song metadata (e.g., artist, title, album) extracted from YouTube. Based on the configuration settings, you can filter and modify the genres and lyrics of the song results.

You can define which genres to exclude and include in the search results.
Genres can be modified using regex patterns and mapped to your preferred genres.
The search results from iTunes will display the song title, artist, album, and artwork. You can select the most relevant result.

## Download Workflow

1. **YouTube Download**: The tool uses yt-dlp to download the song from YouTube. It supports both audio and video downloads, but the default behavior is to download only the audio.

2. **Search and Metadata**: After downloading, the tool queries the iTunes API to find metadata for the song. The metadata includes information such as the artist, album, and genre, which is displayed to the user.

3. **File Management**: Once the download is complete and the metadata is fetched, the file is moved from the temporary folder (tmp) to the specified music folder. If artwork is available, it will be saved with the song.

4. **Error Handling**: If no valid song is found on iTunes or if an error occurs during the download, the tool will notify the user and offer retry options.
